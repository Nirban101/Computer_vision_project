# Computer_vision_project

The aim of this project is bank churn prediction, i.e whether a customer will leave the bank or stay with the bank. This porject has two parts. The first part is 
Cascade_Tabnet(credit: https://github.com/DevashishPrasad/CascadeTabNet) uses CNN to read tabular data from scanned pdf images. 
Steps : 1. We have to import the necessary modules. 2. Clone the repository of the Cascade_Tabnet. 3. Load the pre-trained model. 4. Provide input to the code.
The input of the code is a scanned png image which contains tabular data. 5. Store the output of the data. The output is to be used for further analysis of data.  


The second code analyses the data using deep neural networks and predicts the churning. Given that we obtained the transactions data from Cascade_Tabnet, the next steps are : 1. Read the data from Cascade_tabnet output. For this case lets use a demo file. 2.
